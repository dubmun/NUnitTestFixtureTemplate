This is a simple Visual Studio template that writes your boilerplate code for a NUnit test fixture.

When you add a new item to a project in Visual Studio, the NUnit Test Fixture item will appear in the list of available items. When you select this, it will create a .cs file with a basic skeleton for an NUnit test fixture.

The code assumes that you will be using Rhino Mocks, and adds a using statement for this library.

To install, copy the zip file to your Visual Studio templates directory.
